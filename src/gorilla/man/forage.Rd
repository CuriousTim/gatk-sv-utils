\arguments{
\item{gds_path}{Path to the genomic disorders table file. The format is a
tab-delimited file with the following columns:
\enumerate{
\item chr: contig of the region
\item start_GRCh38: start of the region
\item end_GRCh38: end of the region
\item GD_ID: ID of the region
\item svtype: either 'DEL' or 'DUP'
\item NAHR: either 'yes' or 'no' indicating NAHR-mediated or not
\item terminal: one of 'p', 'q', or 'no' indicating the p-arm, q-arm, or
non-terminal region
\item cluster: either a cluster ID or an empty string
The file must have column headers as given.
}}

\item{sds_path}{Path to a BEDX file of hg38 segmental duplication regions.}

\item{bincov_path}{Path to the binned coverage matrix.}

\item{medians_path}{Path to the median coverages file.}

\item{samples_path}{Path to a list of samples, one-per-line, to process.}

\item{sex_ploidy_path}{Path to a ploidy table. The format is a tab-delimited
file with the following columns:
\enumerate{
\item sample ID
\item chrX ploidy with 0 = unknown, 1 = male, 2 = female
The file must not have column headers.
}}

\item{outdir_path}{Path the output directory. It will be created if it
doesn't exist and any files that match the name of a plot created by the
workflow will be silently overwritten.}

\item{min_shift}{Minimum amount by which the read-depth ratio of a sample
must be shifted from expectation to be considered a GD carrier.}

\item{pad}{Proportion of the GD region that should be included on either
side when plotting.}

\item{max_calls_per_sample}{Maximum number of GD calls a sample can have
before it is marked as an outlier and all of its calls are treated as false.}

\item{outliers_log_path}{Path to a file where the IDs of any outlier samples
will be written. If \code{NULL}, outlier samples are not recorded.}
}
\description{
A convenience function to run the genomic disorder calling workflow on a set
of inputs.
